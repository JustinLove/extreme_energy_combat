        Energy generation is also important.  You want a surplus before the shooting starts or you will be very, very, sorry.  It gives you more staying power and faster recovery.

    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>This mod adds a significant energy drain for units and combat.  In practice with the systems available this means the ammo system applied across the board, as well as recon and nukes.</p>

    <p>Compromises: units are limited to one ammo weapon.  Some units had to be switched to alternating fire, and units with independent turrets have a fixed maintenance cost instead of ammo.  (Unfortunately the game allows you to turn them off; the unit's vision has been tied to power so there is some penalty for doing this.)</p>

    <p>This mod expects that construction costs will be reduced, but does not include those adjustments itself.  Or you could play a super energy-tight game.</p>
